# recordlinkage

This project provides tools to perfom a record linkage. The module, written in Python, is developed for research and linking of small or medium sized files. The module is inspired on the Freely Extensible Biomedical Record Linkage (FEBRL) project, which is a great project. 

The main difference with the FEBRL project is that this project heavily depends on the Panda's library. This flexible and powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python makes the record linkage process much easier. One of the aims of this project is to make it easy to implement your own extensions.
