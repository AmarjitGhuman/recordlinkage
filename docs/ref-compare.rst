Comparing
=========

A set of informative, discriminating and independent features is important for
a good classification of record pairs into matching and distinct pairs. The
:class:`recordlinkage.Compare` class and its methods can be used to compare records
pairs. Several comparison methods are included such as string similarity
measures, numerical measures and distance measures.
