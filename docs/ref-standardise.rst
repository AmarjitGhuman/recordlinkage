Standardising
=============

Cleaning and standardising your data may increase your record linkage
accuracy. The Python Record Linkage Toolkit contains several tools for data
cleaning and standardising. Some of the tools included are: phonetic encoding
algorithms and string cleaning tools. The tools are included in the submodule
``standardise``. (Import example: ``from recordlinkage.standardise import clean,
phonenumbers``)
