Classification
==============

Classification is the step in the record linkage process were record pairs are
classified into matches, non-matches and possible matches [Christen2012_].
Classification algorithms can be supervised or unsupervised (rougly speaking:
with or without training data). Many of the algorithms need trainings data to
classify the record pairs. Trainings data is data for which is known whether
it is a match or not.
